I am an evolutionary biologist that has chosen to investigate evolutionary signatures through the hourglass of molecular biology. I work under the principles of population genetics theory to characterize the footprints of neutral and adaptive evolution alike. I have started my short carrier with the ever accessible mtDNA, then leaped to microsatellites and now directed to NGS

The purpose of this repository is to collect and organize the scripts I have been using, either my own or edited from original ones (will of course be credited) throughout my research pathways.
