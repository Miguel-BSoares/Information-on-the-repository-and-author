I am an evolutionary biologist that has chosen to investigate evolutionary signatures through the hourglass of molecular biology. I work under the principles of population genetics theory to characterize the footprints of neutral and adaptive evolution alike. I have started my carrier with the ever accessible mtDNA, then leaped to microsatellites and now I am fully into next generation sequencing, or NGS. 

The original purpose of creating a GitHub page was to make something more usefull, less selfish, and that would somehow capitalize all the investment I have made through the years on empirical population genetics. It would also bring transparency to my work, as I will be adding future scripts/code too in this repository. Finally, I positive it will also allow me to trace my progress as a researcher and help me to keep track of all the important yet "easy-to-lost-track" scripts. Sounds quite personal, I know, but hey, it is in the internet so now belongs to everybody. 

Hope it helps anybody out there:)

IMPORTANT TO READ: Naturally, the limit is not (unfortunately) the sky but rather my comprehension, creativity, experience and the research oportunities I have been given. 

DISCLAIMER: I will always run potentially wrapper software piece-by-piece so to check errors in every step and see how data behaves. None of these organisms are model organisms.
